                <br>
                <br>
                Please rest assured that this site will only collect personal information that you knowingly and willingly provide to us by way of surveys, completed membership forms, and emails.

                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Security</h3>
                The Gym Of Tucson takes precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline. Wherever we collect sensitive information (e.g. credit card information), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the webpage.                 
                <br>
                <br>
                While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers and servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment. This is all done to prevent any loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or modification of the user's personal information under our control. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Passive Information Collection</h3>
                As you navigate through a website, certain information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing the information) using various technologies and means, such as Internet Protocol addresses, cookies, Internet tags, and navigational data collection.
                <br>
                <br>
                This Website may use Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider (ISP) so you can access the Internet and is generally considered to be non-personally identifiable information, because in most cases an IP address is dynamic (changing each time you connect to the Internet), rather than static (unique to a particular user’s computer). We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our server, report aggregate information, determine the fastest route for your computer to use in connecting to our Website, and administer and improve services to our consumers.
                <br>
                <br>
                A “cookie” is a bit of information that a website sends to your web browser that helps the website remember information about you and your preferences. This Website uses cookies.
                <br>
                <br>
                “Session cookies” are temporary bits of information that are erased once you exit your web browser or otherwise turn your computer off. Session cookies are used to improve navigation on websites and to collect aggregate statistical information. This Website uses session cookies.
                <br>
                <br>
                “Persistent cookies” are more permanent bits of information that are placed on the hard drive of your computer and stay there unless you delete them. Persistent cookies store information on your computer for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided (e.g., a username), helping to determine what areas of the website users find most valuable, and customizing the website based on your preferences. This Website uses persistent cookies.
                <br>
                <br>
                “Internet tags” (also known as pixels, single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, and 1-by-1 GIFs) are smaller than cookies and tell a website server information such as the IP address and browser type related to the user’s computer. This Website uses Internet tags.
                <br>
                <br>
                “Navigational data” (log files, server logs, and clickstream data) and Internet tags are used for system management, to improve the content of a website, market research purposes, and to communicate information to users. This Website uses navigational data.
                <br>
                <br>
